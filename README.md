## Credits

To get the search results we use the Reddit API which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/ and the Guardian API which can be found here: https://open-platform.theguardian.com/

We used Bulma for our CSS framework which can be found here: https://bulma.io/ and Font-Awesome for some of Bulmas dependencies which can be found here: https://fontawesome.com/

We also used MomentJS to convert and format the date time data from the API calls, which can be found here: https://momentjs.com/
